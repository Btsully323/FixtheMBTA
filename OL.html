                <p>The Orange line is one of Boston’s better lines. In 2021, it had a (very unsuccessful and poor) shut down. Since then, there has only been progress on the Orange Line, as the trains are significantly quicker. Surprisingly, I don’t have any issues with the trains themselves, as they’re the newest trains on the system. </p>
<h2>Route Expansion</h2>
<p>I am happy with the Orange Line’s current route, but I do feel as if I could be improved. I don’t necessarily think that northern expansion is necessary, but I haven’t looked into the studies to know. I am primarily focusing on adding onto the southern part of the line. I’d separate the orange line into two separate branches (Like the Red Line’s Ashmont and Braintree branches). The two branches I’d like to see are the Hyde Park Branch and the Mattapan Branch (Name could probably be changed). The Hyde Park Branch would continue past Forest hills to Cummins Hwy to Summer Street to Hyde Park Station. This would add four stops in a part of the Boston suburbs that lacks significant rapid transit. The Mattapan Line would diverge from the current Orange Line at Ruggles to Nubian to MLK Park to Franklin Park Zoo to Blue Hill Ave to Morton Street to existing Mattapan station. These two branches would connect a part of Boston that lacks to the main city in a much more accessible and meaningful way. Hyde Park is one of the only Boston neighborhoods that lack reliable rapid transit, and that’s what this aims to fix.  </p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, the Orange Line is in a good shape, but it could be a lot better. With the “Simple” fix that I came up with, the Orange Line could quickly become one of the most important and reliable subway lines in the entirety of the MBTA. Out of all of the fixes on this website, This is definitely one of the changes I’d personally want to see the most.</p>
