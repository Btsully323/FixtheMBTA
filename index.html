            <h2>Boston’s Public Transportation needs help.</h2>
            <p>Slow zones, track shutdowns, shuttlebuses, and delays. Those are all words that describe the current state of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, otherwise known as the MBTA. Founded in 1897 as “America’s First Subway,” the MBTA has moved people around the city of Boston for well over 120 years. However, in the modern age the T has fallen into a shadow of its former self. Cities around the globe exceed the MBTA’s community reach, time and consistency. Even in America, places such as New York’s MTA, Chicago’s CTA, and DC’s Metro are more reliable and speedier than Boston’s transit system. There are many different reasons why the T has fallen into such a pitiful state such as, but certainly not limited to: Poor funding from the state of Massachusetts, Corrupt and poor management in the past, and a general lack of care for the system by the people who control it.</p>

            <h2>Theres good news!</h2>
            <p>After years of transit advocacy, by sites such as https://transitmatters.org/ and by the people of Massachusetts, the government began to listen. In April of 2023, Massachusetts governor Maura Healey appointed former MTA Chief Operating Officer, Philip Eng to turn the trainwreck of the T around. Due to Eng’s diligent work, the system is in a MUCH better state than it was in previous years. For example, after the Blue Line shutdowns, the blue line is almost 10 minutes faster than it was with the slow zones. Philip Eng has been fixing the T to his best ability, even with an estimated maintenance backlog worth 24.5 million dollars, as reported by the Boston Globe. Things are starting to look promising in Boston, but were not 100 percent of the way there yet – in fact, id argue were quite far from it.</p>
