            The Red Line is one of the most important lines in Boston. It has the highest ridership in the system and should have the infrastructure to support that. There are a couple of thing’s that I would do to fix up the Red Line and make it significantly better for commuters within in the Greater Boston area.
            </p>
            <h2>Replacing the Trains</h2>
            <p>
            Did you know that the Red Line has some of the oldest trains (that are still running) in the system? These cars are the Pullman-Standard cars, built in 1969–1970. Those trains are over 50 years old. Obviously, after that long, the trains begin to deteriorate and begin to cause more and more issues that lead to delays and even potentially safety issues. In April of 2023, a man was caught between the doors of a Red Line train and was killed. The train that he was on was too old to be running. In fact, the train should have been taken out of service in the mid-90s.
            </p>
            <p>
            Luckily there is already a solution in progress! In 2014, The company CRRC Corporation Limited (known as CRRC) was awarded the contract to create new trains for both the Red Line and the Orange Line. Of course, with most things related to the MBTA, this has been plagued by many issues. CRRC has delayed the release of the new Red Line trains multiple times. This has lead to the MBTA being forced to run the again trains more and more. "[CRRC] has completely abandoned its core responsibilities and commitment to lead, monitor and support quality management" said an MBTA spokesperson. All we can do now is hope that CRRC begins to produce more of the Red Line trains so that the aging trains can finally, after 54-55 years, get taken off the tracks.
            </p>
            <h2>Route Expansion</h2>
            <p>
            Did you know that the Red Line was planned to go all the way to Lexington at one point? This never happened due to the town of Lexington heavily protesting it. Fast forward to now, where the town is now signing a petition to bring the Red Line north to Lexington. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Heres what I would do! I would bring the red line north to, past Alewife. I would add three stations, East Arlington, Arlington and Lexington. This would bring vast economic growth to all of the communities that it will go through. These three stations would extend the line by roughly 7 miles. I could see them adding more stations in between, but I have not personally looked at the data to see where they would go, or if its even realistic.
            </p>
            <h2>Fixing the Mattapan line</h2>
            <p>Oh the Mattapan line, its nice and quaint, isn’t it? Waiting 20 minutes for your small, old worn down train to arrive only for it to be insanely full! (A bit of an overdramatization there…) I enjoy the Mattapan line, but its due for change. First off, its frequencies are just far too low. There are waits up to 20 minutes for a train to come. It might honestly be faster to walk it! I am suggesting an increase in frequency of up to 10 minutes. Its not as high ridership wise compared to the rest of the system, so the frequency doesn’t have to be crazy.</p>
            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
            <p>Overall, the Red Line needs work, but I do believe that it can be done – especially with the progress already being made. For example, the people of Lexington signing petitions, and CRRC seemingly understanding that they actually have to do their job. The Red Line is getting better day by day.</p>
