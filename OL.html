              <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>Lets all be real -- the T has issues. This website was made to document them, and my many solutions that I have come up with. All solutions that I have come up with are based of what I find to be facts, and I will strive to make this as unopinionated as possible (but lets be real, thats difficult!)</p>
