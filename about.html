            <div class="Lists">
            <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp; To fix the MBTA</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Inform the public</li>

            <p>FixtheMBTA.com was made as a way to bring general awareness to an issue that plagues not only Boston, but the greater Boston area as a whole.</p>
            <h3>What was your inspiration for making this site?</h3>
            <p>My idea for this site came about when I was browsing the internet and found a website called, "https://www.fixmbta.com/". I noticed that the website was not updated and was made on the free website making service, wix.com. I wanted to do my own take on that site with my own views and solutions.</p>
